## Intro

Developed a front end web application using JavaScript, HTML,CSS to allow user to select food from menu of different Restaurants and add items to cart to place a order.

It displays price , quantity and delivery time of order so that user can adjust the order accordingly and user can bookmark  or unbookmark a item.

User can create profile and add address manually or can allow the application to get location which displays his current location on a map so the user can adjust the location on map.

It requestes the API server I built. The API server I built consist of 40 dishes from 6 resataurants . The server provieds the request with relevant response.


## Demo
